# A07 - Webscrapping Assignment

## Description:
#### This project will combine a python GUI with a beautiful soup web scraper to: 1. grab, 2. save and 3. display the data. The initial python gui will be used to enter the appropriate values to allow you to leverage the URL, meaning it will accept values for: month, day, year, airport code, and daily. The resulting python gui will display the received data in a tabular format.

## What Went Well
#### Implementing the PYSimpleGUI went well as it was easy to use and edit
#### Whenever I fill out the information in the input table and click submit the website is pulled up for a brief second to show that its building the correct URL.

## What Went Wrong
#### I am still unable to get it to properly scrape the website. 
#### I keep getting an error message stating "No weather data available for the selected date and airport."
